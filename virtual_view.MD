## LDM_MV definition
### user defined LDM(MV)
* user only define the logic, which define a logic model, the model contains PK
* user can use LDM(MV) and ODS table to compose business logic, may user temporary view or CTE like structure to compose the logic
* the data will be materialized by the system, depend on the actually usage or user configuration
* actually execution plan can be re-write by the system
### Auto defined MV
* common ETL process from batch job
* common logic from user query

## LDM_MV Benifits
### the business logic is binded to the model, the dependency is naturally defined
### partial columns can be materialized from the ODS layer
* Data Granularity do not change, the column and row filtering can be pushed down
* ETL process can be re-write to improve performance, use MV instead of ODS table

## CBO & Execution
### Materialized Process
#### User defined LDM & MV
* User Defined LDM(MV) will be executed on a specified time point
* Whether the execution plan will be re-write is depended on the availability of Materialized data
#### System auto generated MV
* A dependency lineage need to be generated by the system
* MV Materialization will be kicked off once the source data is ready.

### logic query re-write
logic query plan can be re-write depended on the availability of data Materialized
#### ETL query process
* Logic SQL contains in the job will be kicked off by schedule jobs, the sql execution plan will be re-written based on the availability of materialized data
* The filter condition will be pushed down to the first seen of the materialized data or the ODS table, to improve the performance and save cost.
#### User logic
* user query will be re-written based on the availability of materialized data
* the actually plan may use original table, materialzied view or ODS data, decided by CBO.
